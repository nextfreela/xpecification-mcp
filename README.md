# Xpecification MCP — Specs as the Source of Truth for AI Coding Agents

Xpecification is the home for product, feature, and architectural specs. The Xpecification MCP server gives local AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, …) **read and write access to those specs**, so agents can plan, implement, and update features against the spec — not against stale `docs/`, hallucinated APIs, or whatever the model remembers from training.

## ❌ Without Xpecification MCP

Coding agents drift from your product's actual contracts. You get:

- ❌ Code that ships ahead of the spec, then quietly diverges
- ❌ Implementations that contradict ADRs nobody re-read
- ❌ Duplicate "RFC-2025-…" markdown files in the repo, none authoritative
- ❌ Specs updated only after the code lands, when nobody can challenge them

## ✅ With Xpecification MCP

The agent reads the **current** spec before writing code, and proposes spec changes through the same workflow a human reviewer approves.

```
Implement the password-reset flow per the "auth/password-reset" spec.
Use the contracts and error codes from §4. If the spec is incomplete,
open a draft, fill it in, and request review before writing code.
```

```
What ADRs apply to background jobs in this product? Read them, then
critique my proposed worker change against them.
```

The agent calls `read_specification`, `list_open_questions`, `start_new_version`, `update_specification_section`, `request_review` — and you stay in control: **a human still marks the draft Reviewed in the Xpecification UI**.

## 📚 Concepts

- **Workspace** — top-level container. Contains member Products plus its own Workspace-scoped specs (e.g., cross-product ADRs).
- **Product** — a single product or service. Holds the feature, UX, and architecture specs that govern its codebase.
- **Specification** — Markdown document with status (`Draft` → `Needs Review` → `Reviewed`), open questions, and a version history.
- **Binding** — a `.xpecification.json` at the repo root binds the local checkout to a Workspace and/or Product, so agents don't have to pass ids on every call.

See `app.xpecification.com` for the dashboard and to mint a token.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 20.11**
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Claude Desktop, …)
- An **Xpecification Personal Access Token** — generate one at `https://app.xpecification.com/settings/developer`
- A repo with a `.xpecification.json` file (or `XPECIFICATION_WORKSPACE_ID` / `XPECIFICATION_PRODUCT_ID` env vars). See [Binding the workspace](#binding-the-workspace) below.

### **Install in Claude Code**

Run this command. See the [Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for more info.

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user \
  -e XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN \
  xpecification -- npx -y @nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp
```

Drop `--scope user` to install only for the current project.

To add a rule so the agent always reads the spec first, append the snippet from [Add a rule](#add-a-rule) below to your `CLAUDE.md`.

### **Install in Cursor**

Add this to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project). See the [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in VS Code**

See the [VS Code MCP docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in Windsurf**

Add this to your Windsurf MCP config. See the [Windsurf MCP docs](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in Zed**

Add this to your Zed `settings.json`. See the [Zed Context Server docs](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/context-servers).

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "Xpecification": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in Claude Desktop**

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json`. See the [Claude Desktop MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in OpenAI Codex**

See the [OpenAI Codex repo](https://github.com/openai/codex) for more on the MCP configuration format. Codex reads `~/.codex/config.toml`.

#### Codex Local Server Connection (stdio)

```toml
[mcp_servers.xpecification]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"]
env = { XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN" }
startup_timeout_ms = 20_000
```

#### Codex Remote Server Connection (HTTP)

First, run the server (see [Running over HTTP](#running-over-http-hosted-agents)). Then point Codex at it:

```toml
[mcp_servers.xpecification]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:3030/mcp"
http_headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" }
```

> Optional troubleshooting — only if Codex reports startup "request timed out" or "program not found". Most users can ignore this.
>
> - First try: bump `startup_timeout_ms` to `40_000`.
> - **Windows** quick fix (absolute `npx` path + explicit env):
>
>   ```toml
>   [mcp_servers.xpecification]
>   command = "C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\npx.cmd"
>   args = ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"]
>   env = {
>     XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN",
>     SystemRoot = "C:\\Windows",
>     APPDATA = "C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Roaming"
>   }
>   startup_timeout_ms = 40_000
>   ```
>
> - **macOS** quick fix (call Node directly with the installed package's entry point):
>
>   ```toml
>   [mcp_servers.xpecification]
>   command = "/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node"
>   args = [
>     "/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/lib/node_modules/@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp/dist/cli.js",
>     "--stdio"
>   ]
>   env = { XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN" }
>   ```
>
> Replace `yourname` with your OS username. On Windows, setting `APPDATA` and `SystemRoot` is essential because `npx` requires them but some Codex builds don't pass them through.

### **Using Bun or Deno**

Any client that launches an MCP server via `command + args` can swap `npx` for an alternative runtime.

#### Bun

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": { "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Deno

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--allow-env",
        "--allow-net",
        "--allow-read",
        "npm:@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"
      ],
      "env": { "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Install in Windows**

`npx` on Windows usually needs to be invoked via `cmd /c`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpecification": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp"],
      "env": { "XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running over HTTP (hosted agents)

For agents that consume MCP over HTTP/SSE rather than stdio, run the server explicitly:

```bash
XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN \
  npx -y @nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp --http --port 3030 --cors-origin https://your-agent.example.com
```

Then point your hosted agent at `http://<host>:3030/mcp`.

## 🔗 Binding the workspace

The MCP server is **bound** to a Workspace and/or a Product so tools like `list_specifications` work without passing ids every call.

Drop a `.xpecification.json` at your repo root:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "ws_…",
  "productId": "prd_…"
}
```

Either field is optional:

| Configuration               | Effective mode      | What works                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaceId` + `productId` | `workspace+product` | Everything; defaults to the Product's specs                               |
| `workspaceId` only          | `workspace`         | Workspace-scoped specs + cross-Product search                             |
| `productId` only            | `product`           | Product-scoped specs (orphan / pre-aggregation Products work this way)    |
| Neither                     | `discovery`         | Only `list_workspaces` / `list_products` — bind first to do anything else |

You can also use environment variables: `XPECIFICATION_WORKSPACE_ID`, `XPECIFICATION_PRODUCT_ID`. The file wins over env vars when both are present.

## ✅ Verify the install

```bash
XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN npx -y @nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp --check
```

Prints `OK: https://app.xpecification.com reachable, N product(s) visible.` on success, or a structured error code (`AUTH_REQUIRED`, `PRODUCT_NOT_BOUND`, …) and remediation when something is off. Add `--json` for machine-readable output.

## 🔨 Available Tools

All tools take ids as strings. Bound Workspace/Product ids are inferred from `.xpecification.json` unless overridden in the call.

### Read tools

| Tool                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_workspaces`             | List Workspaces visible to the token. Use when you don't yet know which Workspace to bind.                                                                                             |
| `list_products`               | List Products. With a Workspace binding, returns its member Products; without, returns orphan Products.                                                                                |
| `read_workspace`              | Workspace metadata: name, description, type, archived state.                                                                                                                           |
| `read_product`                | Product metadata: name, description, `specificationManagementType`, member-of Workspace.                                                                                               |
| `list_specifications`         | List specs in scope. Filters: `type` (BUSINESS / UX / DESIGN_SYSTEM / DOCUMENT), `status` (DRAFT / GENERATING / NEEDS_REVIEW / REVIEWED), `folder`, `tags`, `query`. Cursor-paginated. |
| `search_specifications`       | Lexical full-text search across spec titles and content. Workspace bindings search the Workspace plus every member Product; results carry a `scope` discriminator.                     |
| `read_specification`          | Current Markdown body of a spec, plus status and OCC `version`. Use `format="rendered"` to strip open-question and assumption markers.                                                 |
| `list_specification_versions` | Reviewed snapshots of a spec, newest first.                                                                                                                                            |
| `read_specification_version`  | Full Markdown of a specific approved revision. Pair with `list_specification_versions` to diff history against current.                                                                |
| `list_open_questions`         | Questions and assumptions attached to a spec. Resolved/dismissed items are excluded unless `includeResolved=true`.                                                                     |

### Write tools

| Tool                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start_new_version`            | Open a new Draft of a Reviewed spec. Required before any write tool on a published spec. No-op when the spec is already a Draft (returns `hint="already_draft"`).                                        |
| `update_specification_content` | Replace the full Markdown body of a Draft. OCC-guarded — pass the `version` from your most recent `read_specification`. Returns `STALE_VERSION` (409) if another writer landed first; re-read and retry. |
| `update_specification_section` | Replace one heading-bound section (`sectionPath="## Pricing"`). OCC-guarded. Records a before-image revision.                                                                                            |
| `request_review`               | Move a Draft to `Needs Review` for a human to approve. Rejected with `OPEN_QUESTIONS_PRESENT` if questions remain — surface them to the user first.                                                      |
| `discard_draft`                | Roll a Draft (or Needs Review) back to its last approved version. Rejected on specs that have never been approved.                                                                                       |
| `create_free_specification`    | Create a new Markdown spec in the bound Free product. Path uniqueness is enforced. Rejected with `PRODUCT_TYPE_MISMATCH` on Web Application Products — use `start_new_version` on a structured spec.     |

> **Note** — the agent never calls "mark reviewed". Approval stays a human action in the Xpecification UI. The MCP can only nudge a draft to `Needs Review`.

## 🛟 Tips

### Add a rule

Once installed, tell your agent to consult Xpecification before writing code. Drop this into `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, or your client's equivalent:

```
Before writing or updating code, planning a feature, or making an architectural
choice, search and read the relevant Xpecification specs via the xpecification
MCP. Treat them as the source of truth. If a spec is wrong or incomplete, open
a draft (start_new_version), update it (update_specification_section), and
request review (request_review) before implementing. Never duplicate spec
content into the repo.
```

The repo's `CLAUDE.md` is a good place for project-specific guidance.

### Use ids when you have them

If you already know the spec id, pass it directly to skip the search:

```
Read the "auth/password-reset" spec and reconcile §4 with the current
src/server/auth/reset.ts implementation. specId=spec_01H…
```

### Self-hosted / dev API

Override the API base URL at the binding:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "workspaceId": "ws_local_dev",
  "productId": "prd_local_dev"
}
```

`http://localhost` is allowed without `--allow-insecure`. For any other non-HTTPS host, pass `--allow-insecure` (intended for self-hosted dev only).

### HTTPS proxy

Standard `https_proxy` / `HTTPS_PROXY` env vars are honoured.

## 💻 Development

```bash
# From the monorepo root
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the built server:

```bash
XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN node dist/cli.js
```

### CLI Arguments

`xpecification-mcp` accepts:

- `serve` _(default)_ — run the MCP server. Stdio unless `--http` is set.
- `--check` — verify token + API URL and exit `0`/`1`. Pair with `--json` for scripting.
- `--help`, `-h` — usage.
- `--stdio` — run over stdio (default; for desktop agents).
- `--http` — run as an HTTP/SSE server (for hosted agents).
- `--port <n>` — port for `--http` (default `3030`).
- `--host <addr>` — host for `--http` (default `127.0.0.1`).
- `--cors-origin <o>` — origin to allow (repeatable). Without this, cross-origin browser requests are rejected.
- `--api-url <url>` — override the Xpecification API base URL.
- `--allow-insecure` — permit a non-HTTPS `apiUrl` (self-hosted dev only).

### Environment Variables

| Variable                     | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN`    | **Required.** Personal Access Token from `/settings/developer`.     |
| `XPECIFICATION_API_URL`      | Override the API base URL. Default `https://app.xpecification.com`. |
| `XPECIFICATION_WORKSPACE_ID` | Default Workspace binding when no `.xpecification.json` is present. |
| `XPECIFICATION_PRODUCT_ID`   | Default Product binding when no `.xpecification.json` is present.   |
| `XPECIFICATION_TELEMETRY`    | Set to `0` to disable anonymous telemetry.                          |
| `XPECIFICATION_LOG_LEVEL`    | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` (default `info`).            |

The `--api-url` CLI flag takes precedence over `XPECIFICATION_API_URL`. The `.xpecification.json` `apiUrl` field falls between the two.

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
XPECIFICATION_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN \
  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @nextfreelatech/xpecification-mcp
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**`AUTH_REQUIRED` / 401 from every tool** — token is missing, expired, or revoked. Mint a new one at `/settings/developer` and update your client's `env`.

**`PRODUCT_NOT_BOUND` / `WORKSPACE_NOT_BOUND`** — the tool needs a binding the session doesn't have. Either pass `productId` / `workspaceId` explicitly, or add it to `.xpecification.json` (see [Binding the workspace](#binding-the-workspace)).

**`STALE_VERSION` from `update_specification_*`** — another writer landed between your read and your write. Re-call `read_specification` to get the current `version`, then retry.

**`OPEN_QUESTIONS_PRESENT` from `request_review`** — call `list_open_questions` first, resolve them in the spec, then retry.

**Legacy `.xpecification.json` shape rejected at startup** — the binding format changed; the CLI prints a remediation pointing to the new shape. Update the file.

**`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` under `npx`** — try `bunx` instead. It often resolves stale npm caches.

**Plain-HTTP `apiUrl`** — only `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` are allowed by default. For any other host, pass `--allow-insecure` (self-hosted dev only).
